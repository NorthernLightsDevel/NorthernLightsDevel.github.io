My name is Per Øyvind Håvelsrud, and I'm the NothernLightsDeveloper.

The name isn't just a gimmick; it’s a nod to where my journey with technology truly began. During a year studying space technology at Andøya, I had two pivotal discoveries: the elegant physics of the Aurora Borealis, thanks to Kristian Birkeland's foundational science, and the creative power of programming, through my first encounter with Borland C++. That intersection of natural wonder and logical structure has defined my passion ever since.

Like many Norwegians who grew up in the 90s I didn't get access to my first compyter before the age of 10, my journey then, begun by tinkering with VB scripts I didn't fully understand. But that year in Andøya ignited a purpose. Today, I am a professional consultant and software developer, guided by a philosophy I call **Pragmatic Craftsmanship**. I believe in building robust, effective solutions while honoring the craft of writing clean, readable, and performant code. This isn't just theoretical; it's an approach I've applied in demanding roles, including serving as a tech lead and developing systems to manage power grid usage data for Elvia, the utility provider for Oslo.

My career has been a journey of evolution. It began with hardware, automating tests for a manufacturing plant where I learned C# to interface with `TestStand` and `LabVIEW`. That role pushed me to go deeper, teaching myself `VHDL` to design a video switch matrix and `embedded C` to build test equipment that reported back over `Telnet`, `USB`, and `RS232`.

After ending my time as a test developer, I joined a web development company specialising in delivering a CRM solution to Member organizations, at this position, I worked as a lead developer on their effort to modernize from a solution designed in the 90's, to a more modern solution designed for the late 2010s, The original solution built on `VB.NET` with `WebForms` and hosted in `IIS`, needed modernization. We decided against a full rewrite, as one of the original creators argued it would be too time-consuming. While I pragmatically agreed that a complete rewrite isn't always the best option, with more experience, I would have redesigned much more of the solution today. The existing solution were lacking cohesionand relied heavily on `VB.NET`'s loose interpretation for 'automatic' data binding, which often led to issues during the modernization project.

While my roots are deep in the Microsoft ecosystem (`C#`, `VB.NET`, `IIS`, `TFS`), my curiosity has led me on countless side quests. I've migrated companies from `TFS` to `Git`, navigated a broad spectrum of databases from `SQL Server` to `Google Bigtable`, and explored the frontend with `jQuery`, `Vue`, and `Angular`. This path of continuous learning eventually led me from the comfort of JetBrains Rider to the minimalist power of `Neovim` and the granular control of Arch Linux—a journey of enlightenment I continue to document on this blog.

#### Beyond the Code

When I’m not at the keyboard, my time is spent with my wife and two kids. I find balance and focus in the outdoors while deer hunting in the fall, in the precision of competitive pistol shooting, and in the tangible progress of home renovation.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something useful or interesting in my documented journey.
